            Using hand-drawn animations, explainers, skits, and interviews,
            young leaders from Durham, North Carolina unpack the concept of
            belonging in a creative and energetic fashion. Combining research
            with their own life experiences, Hoodies, Hair, and Heritage
            presents promises and possibilities for a brighter tomorrow, and can
            be used to spark next-level conversations among educators, students,
            parents, and policymakers. Watch and listen closely as scholars from
            Shepard Magnet Middle School, Hillside High School, J. D. Clement
            Early College High School, Bethesda Elementary School, and City of
            Medicine Academy teach us a thing or two about how belonging looks
            from their point of view.
